# MatlabFunctions

This repository should not only be the start of a collection of usefull matlab functions, BUT also the start of my github account. 

The idea is to write usefull functions to automate most of the exercises I have to to at Carinthian University of Applied Science. 
But I'm sure that a lot of functions will be usefull in the daily business of an engineer. 

Feel free to drop your ideas for new functions as well as ideas to potentially improve existing functions!
